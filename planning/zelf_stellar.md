## Executive Summary

Zelf Legacy brings **production-grade biometric inheritance infrastructure** to the Stellar ecosystem. It enables Stellar wallets, custodians, and financial applications to support secure, non-custodial, privacy-preserving post-mortem asset transfer without exposing private keys, storing biometric data, or relying on centralized oracle trust assumptions.

Unlike theoretical or architecture-stage proposals, Zelf Legacy is **already under active development** on Solana (with Light Protocol for ZK-compressed heartbeats) and Avalanche, with a working biometric SDK shipping across 3 platforms (Web Extension, iOS, Android). This grant funds the **Stellar-native adaptation** of proven infrastructure, not a from-scratch research project.

## Products & Services

### What Is Zelf Legacy?

Zelf Legacy solves the most critical unaddressed problem in crypto: **"What happens to your assets when you die?"**

Unlike traditional inheritance solutions that require transferring funds to a third-party smart contract (creating custody risk, smart contract risk, and liquidity lock), Zelf Legacy focuses on **access rights inheritance**. We **do not move your funds**. We securely transmit access rights to your designated beneficiaries only upon verified inactivity and rigorous multi-factor biometric proof.

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Create Your Will

The asset holder enables "Legacy Mode" in their Zelf Name Service App, designating beneficiaries. Each beneficiary's identity is cryptographically bound using ZelfProof biometric encryption. Their face becomes the key, but **no biometric data is ever stored anywhere**.

- Legal Smart Contract Wrapper on Soroban
- Biometric Beneficiary Designation via ZelfProof
- Policy encrypted and stored on IPFS & Arweave (immutable, decentralized)
- Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) splits the seed phrase into shares for 1 to 5 beneficiaries and the lawyer; all must collaborate to unlock the original wallet

#### Step 2: Heartbeat Protocol

The Zelf app sends periodic cryptographic "heartbeat" signals to the Soroban inheritance contract, proving the asset holder is alive and active. Using **ZK-compressed state proofs** (adapted from our Light Protocol integration on Solana), these heartbeat signals are:

- **Privacy-preserving**: No one can determine if a user has an active inheritance policy
- **Tamper-proof**: Heartbeats are cryptographically signed with liveness detection
- **Customizable**: Users define inactivity periods (30 days to 24 months) and grace periods
- **Cost-efficient**: ZK compression reduces on-chain storage costs by 100-1000x

#### Step 3: Secure Claim

After the inactivity period and grace period expire, beneficiaries can initiate a claim. The claim process enforces **triple-layer verification**:

1. **Biometric Face Matching**: Each claimant's live face is matched against the ZelfProof registered by the original holder, without revealing any party's biometric data.
2. **ID Document Verification**: Government-issued ID validation through Verifik's production KYC infrastructure (supporting 190+ countries). (Verifik is our web2 company)
3. **Zero-Knowledge Unlocking**: The Soroban contract verifies the ZK proof of entitlement and releases access credentials. Private keys are never exposed.

### Why This Is Superior to Fund-Transfer Inheritance

| Approach | Fund Transfer (typical approach) | Access Rights (Zelf Legacy) |
|---|---|---|
| **User retains control** | No. Funds locked in contract | Yes. Full control until inheritance |
| **Smart contract risk** | High. Funds at risk if contract is exploited | Minimal. Contract holds policies, not funds |
| **DeFi composability** | Broken. Locked funds can't be used | Preserved. Assets remain active |
| **Yield/staking** | Lost during lock period | Continues normally |
| **Multi-chain assets** | Requires per-chain deployment | Single policy covers cross-chain access |
| **Legal enforceability** | Uncertain. Code-is-law | Supported. Produces verifiable evidence for lawful off-chain execution |

### 1. ZelfProof Biometric Engine (Existing, Production)

Our proprietary biometric encryption technology operates **entirely offline, without servers, databases, or internet connectivity**:

- **Input**: User's face (captured locally via device camera) and metadata to encrypt
- **Process**: `ZelfEncrypt` proprietary algorithm: elliptic curve cryptography combined with neural face feature extraction
- **Output**: `ZelfProof`, an encrypted packet **devoid of any biometric information**, safe for on-chain storage and transmission

**Why this matters for Stellar**: No other inheritance solution can perform identity verification without a centralized server or oracle trust assumption. Zelf enables **truly decentralized beneficiary verification**. The Soroban contract can validate entitlement without ever seeing, storing, or processing biometric data.

**Platform availability (shipping today):**
- JavaScript/TypeScript SDK (Web)
- iOS SDK (Swift)
- Android SDK (Java/Kotlin)

### 2. Soroban Inheritance Registry Contract (To Be Developed)

A Soroban smart contract implementing:

- **Policy Registration**: Asset holders register inheritance policies specifying 1 to 5 beneficiaries and the lawyer, Shamir's Secret Sharing threshold configuration, and inactivity thresholds. The seed phrase is split into shares (Using Shamir's secret) at policy creation; no asset allocation or fund transfer is involved.
- **Heartbeat Tracking**: Receives and validates ZK-compressed heartbeat proofs, updating the policy's liveness state using Soroban's `Persistent` storage
- **Claim Processing**: Validates beneficiary entitlement proofs (ZelfProof verification), enforces grace periods, and upon successful verification, enables beneficiaries and lawyer to reconstruct the seed phrase from their Shamir shares.
- **Multi-sig Support**: Optional integration with Stellar's native multi-signature capabilities for institutional use cases
- **Soroban Storage Optimization**: Uses Soroban's three-tier storage model (Persistent for policies, Temporary for heartbeat state, Instance for contract config) to minimize costs

**Migration advantage**: Both Solana and Soroban use **Rust** as the primary smart contract language. Our existing Solana program logic (written in Rust with Anchor) can be adapted to Soroban's SDK with these changes:
- Replace Anchor macros with Soroban's `#[contract]` and `#[contractimpl]` macros
- Adapt account model (Solana accounts → Soroban typed storage)
- Replace `msg.sender` patterns with Soroban's `require_auth()` model
- Use Soroban's native `Env` parameter for blockchain interaction
- Use `soroban-sdk` testing utilities instead of Anchor's test framework

**Estimated porting effort**: 60-70% of business logic is directly reusable. Storage patterns and authentication require rewriting.

### 3. Heartbeat Protocol (Adapted from Solana/Light Protocol)

On Solana, we use Light Protocol for ZK-compressed state management. On Stellar/Soroban, we will adapt this to:

- **Soroban Events**: Use Soroban's event system for heartbeat emission (lower cost than state storage)
- **Merkle Proof Accumulator**: Implement a compact Merkle tree in the Soroban contract to track heartbeat history without per-beat state bloat
- **BLS12-381 Support**: Use Soroban's native BLS12-381 elliptic curve support for efficient ZK proof verification on-chain
- **Compressed Proofs (optional)**: Batch multiple heartbeats into a single proof, submitted periodically to minimize transaction costs

### 4. Guardian Oracle Service (Existing Architecture)

A notification service that:

- Monitors inactivity time and grace period; when both expire, notifies the lawyer that the people involved in the inheritance plan can access the creator's funds
- If the lawyer is unaware of the process or fails to notify beneficiaries, automatically notifies beneficiaries directly after an additional grace period
- Provides Soroban-compatible oracle responses via standardized interface

### 5. Developer SDK & Integration Layer (To Be Developed for Stellar)

- **Stellar Wallet SDK**: Drop-in module for Stellar wallets to add "Legacy Mode"
- **Soroban Contract SDK**: High-level Rust crate wrapping the inheritance contract interactions
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Client**: For web applications integrating inheritance features
- **REST API Bridge**: For custodians and institutions preferring traditional API integration

### Why Stellar?

Stellar's architecture is uniquely suited for inheritance infrastructure:

1. **Low transaction costs**: Heartbeat signals and policy updates must be economically sustainable over years or decades. Stellar's sub-cent fees make this viable.
2. **5-second finality**: Critical for time-sensitive claim processing
3. **Soroban's Rust ecosystem**: Direct code portability from our Solana Rust codebase
4. **BLS12-381 support**: Native support for the cryptographic curves our ZK proofs require
5. **Real-world financial infrastructure**: Stellar's focus on real-world assets and financial inclusion aligns with inheritance, a fundamentally real-world financial need.
6. **Multi-asset support**: A single seed phrase unlocks the wallet holding assets across chains; inheritance policies govern wallet access, not per-asset allocation
7. **Regulatory alignment**: Stellar's compliance-friendly design supports the legal enforceability requirements of inheritance

## Requested Budget

**Total: $90,000 USD (in XLM)**

### Tranche 1: MVP ($25,000)

**Deliverable 1: Soroban Inheritance Registry Contract + ZelfProof Integration** + Demo in Testnet

**Timeline:** 5 weeks

**Description:**

Build the Soroban contract that stores inheritance policy metadata (who holds which Shamir share, inactivity windows, grace periods) and enforces claim eligibility. The contract integrates with ZelfProof for biometric verification of beneficiaries and the lawyer. Users register 1 to 5 beneficiaries plus a lawyer; the seed phrase is split into shares at setup. When the claim flow completes, beneficiaries and lawyer reconstruct the phrase off-chain. No funds ever touch the contract.

We adapt the state machine and policy rules from our live Solana build (which is very expensive at the moment), swapping Anchor for Soroban macros and PDAs for typed storage.

**Deliverables:**

- Soroban smart contract implementing inheritance policy logic deployed on Stellar Testnet
- ZelfProof verification module integrated into the contract (on-chain proof validation)
- Ability to create an inheritance policy specifying:
  - 1 to 5 beneficiaries and the lawyer (each with ZelfProof biometric binding)
  - Shamir's Secret Sharing configuration (threshold for reconstruction)
  - Claim conditions (inactivity period, grace period)
  - No asset allocation; policy governs wallet access only
- Heartbeat Protocol implementation on Soroban:
  - Heartbeat accumulator contract (tracks liveness signals)
  - Privacy-preserving heartbeat emission (no policy existence leakage)
  - Configurable inactivity thresholds (30 days to 24 months)
  - Grace period management with notification hooks
  - Merkle proof-based heartbeat history verification
- Successful execution of a simulated inheritance event on Stellar Testnet demonstrating:
  - Policy creation with biometric binding
  - Heartbeat submission and tracking (with liveness detection)
  - Inactivity detection and claim eligibility
  - Beneficiary verification via ZelfProof
  - Seed phrase reconstruction from Shamir shares (no fund transfers)
- Public GitHub repository containing:
  - Soroban contract code (Rust)
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests using `soroban-cli`
  - Deployment scripts for Testnet
- Technical documentation:
  - Contract architecture diagrams
  - Policy configuration guide
  - Comparison with Solana implementation (migration notes)
  - live demo working with testnet

### Tranche 2: Testnet ($35,000)

**Deliverable 2: Guardian Oracle + Claim Verification Pipeline**

**Timeline:** 5 weeks

**Description:**

Implementation of the Guardian Oracle notification service and the claim verification pipeline. When inactivity and grace period expire, the oracle notifies the lawyer (or beneficiaries directly if the lawyer does not act). The claim flow validates that the claimant matches the registered ZelfProof before enabling seed phrase reconstruction.

**Deliverables:**

- Guardian Oracle Service:
  - Soroban-compatible oracle interface contract on Stellar Testnet
  - Monitors inactivity and grace period; notifies lawyer when beneficiaries can access funds
  - Fallback: if lawyer does not notify beneficiaries, automatically notifies beneficiaries after additional grace period
  - Oracle node reference implementation
- Claim verification pipeline:
  - When a beneficiary claims, they prove they match the registered ZelfProof (biometric verification runs client-side)
  - Contract validates the claim is authorized; no identity data is stored or exposed on-chain
- End-to-end test demonstrating complete workflow:
  - Policy creation → heartbeat monitoring → inactivity detection → lawyer notification (or direct beneficiary notification if lawyer does not act) → beneficiary claim → ZelfProof verification → seed phrase reconstruction from Shamir shares
- Open-source repositories:
  - Guardian Oracle interface and reference implementation
  - Integration test suite
- Technical documentation:
  - Oracle interface specification
  - Claim verification flow and security model

### Tranche 3: Mainnet ($30,000)

**Deliverable 3: Developer SDK, Wallet Integration, Documentation & Mainnet Launch**

**Timeline:** 5 weeks

**Description:**

Creation of developer tooling, wallet integration modules, and documentation enabling any Stellar wallet, custodian, or financial application to add inheritance capabilities. Includes a demonstration application, mainnet deployment, and UX-ready onboarding flows.

## Alternative Approaches and Their Limitations

Some inheritance solutions in the ecosystem use a fund-transfer model: verifiable life-status attestations trigger conditional asset transfers to or through smart contracts. This approach shares several common pitfalls:

#### 1. Architecture Stage vs. Production

Many proposals remain at the "architecture validation stage" with only design documents, patent applications, and early ecosystem discussions. No shipping product, no users, no SDK.

**Zelf's position**: We have production SDKs across 5 platforms, enterprise customers (Circle, Ar.io, Pinata), a shipping wallet app, and active multi-chain development of the Legacy feature.

#### 2. Undefined Zero-Knowledge Implementation

Solutions that claim "zero-knowledge entitlement verification" often provide no specifics on which ZK framework they will use, how proofs will be generated or verified, or how they will handle the substantial research challenges in ZK circuit development. Building production-grade ZK infrastructure from scratch typically requires $500K to $2M+ and dedicated teams.

**Zelf's position**: We use a production-proven biometric verification system (ZelfProof) that already performs zero-knowledge face matching without storing biometric data. No new ZK circuits need to be designed from scratch. We adapt existing production infrastructure.

#### 3. Fund-Transfer Model Creates Unacceptable Risk

Approaches that involve "conditional asset transfers" require funds to be moved to or through smart contracts. This creates custody risk (smart contract bugs), opportunity cost (locked funds cannot participate in DeFi or staking), composability loss (assets become illiquid), and regulatory exposure (holding user funds may trigger money transmitter regulations).

**Zelf's position**: We transfer **access rights**, not funds. Assets remain in the user's wallet, fully under their control, earning yield, participating in DeFi, until the moment of inheritance. This is fundamentally safer and more practical.

#### 4. Single Oracle Dependency

Solutions that rely on external oracle interfaces for death-status attestations create a single point of failure and trust. If the oracle is compromised, manipulated, or unavailable, the entire system fails.

**Zelf's position**: Our three-layer verification (Heartbeat Protocol + Liveness Detection + KYC Matching) creates defense in depth. The heartbeat is automated and tamper-proof. The claim process requires physical biometric presence. No single oracle can trigger false inheritance.

#### 5. Execution Risk

Projects with minimal teams or unproven engineering capacity face significant execution risk when the scope includes Soroban smart contracts, ZK circuits, oracle infrastructure, and developer SDKs.

**Zelf's position**: Zelf/Verifik has 10+ engineers with 5+ years of production experience in biometrics, identity verification, blockchain integration, and SDK development across multiple platforms.

#### 6. Ecosystem Integration

Solutions without existing users, wallet partnerships, or SDK users have not demonstrated the ability to ship developer tools that the ecosystem will adopt.

**Zelf's position**: Our biometric SDKs are already integrated by enterprise customers. We have proven our ability to ship cross-platform tools that developers actually use.

## Soroban / Stellar Technical Adaptation Plan

### What We Already Have (Portable)

| Component | Current Stack | Soroban Adaptation Effort |
|---|---|---|
| **ZelfProof Engine** | TypeScript/Native (offline) | **None**. Runs client-side, chain-agnostic |
| **Inheritance Business Logic** | Rust (Solana/Anchor) | **Medium**. Same language, different SDK/macros |
| **Heartbeat Protocol** | Solana + Light Protocol (ZK compression) | **Medium**. Adapt to Soroban events and Merkle tree |
| **Biometric SDKs** | Web, iOS, Android, Flutter, RN | **None**. Client-side, chain-agnostic |
| **KYC/AML Verification** | Verifik Production API | **None**. Backend service, chain-agnostic |
| **Guardian Oracle** | Node.js service | **Low**. Adapt to Soroban oracle interface |
| **Arweave/IPFS Storage** | Production integration | **None**. Storage layer is chain-agnostic |

### Key Technical Differences: Soroban vs. Solana

| Aspect | Solana (Current) | Soroban (Target) |
|---|---|---|
| **Language** | Rust (Anchor framework) | Rust (Soroban SDK) |
| **Runtime** | SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) | WASM (WebAssembly) |
| **Auth Model** | `msg.sender` implicit | `require_auth()` explicit |
| **Storage** | Accounts (PDAs) | Typed storage (Persistent/Temporary/Instance) |
| **Finality** | ~400ms | ~5 seconds |
| **Tx Cost** | ~$0.00025 | ~$0.0001 |
| **ZK Support** | Via Light Protocol (external) | Native BLS12-381 curves |
| **Testing** | Anchor test framework | `soroban-cli` + SDK test utils |
| **Token Standard** | SPL Tokens | Stellar Assets + Soroban Tokens |

### Migration Strategy

1. **Core contract logic**: Port Rust business logic from Anchor macros to Soroban macros. Storage patterns change significantly (PDAs → typed storage), but the inheritance state machine is identical.

2. **Authentication**: Replace implicit `msg.sender` with Soroban's explicit `require_auth()`. More verbose but equally secure.

3. **ZK compression**: Replace Light Protocol integration with Soroban-native approach using BLS12-381 curves for proof verification and Merkle accumulator for heartbeat compression.

4. **Token interactions**: Replace SPL token operations with Stellar asset and Soroban token operations.

5. **Testing**: Migrate from Anchor's test framework to Soroban's built-in testing utilities, which provide simulated environments and cost estimation.

## Post-Launch Maintenance

After mainnet launch, Zelf commits to:

1. **Ongoing contract maintenance**: Bug fixes, security patches, and Soroban version upgrades
2. **SDK updates**: Keeping pace with Stellar SDK releases and wallet ecosystem changes
3. **Oracle operation**: Continuous operation of Guardian Oracle service nodes
4. **Developer support**: Active GitHub issue management, documentation updates, and community engagement
5. **Ecosystem expansion**: Integrating with additional Stellar wallets and custodians as they adopt the standard
6. **Revenue model**: Sustainable through Zelf's existing SaaS licensing (per-transaction and per-annual-active-user pricing). The grant funds development, not operations.

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Soroban contract security | Third-party audit by Ackee Blockchain or OtterSec before mainnet |
| ZK proof performance on Soroban | Use native BLS12-381 support; fallback to off-chain verification with on-chain attestation |
| Oracle manipulation | Multi-signal attestation requirement; no single oracle can trigger inheritance |
| Regulatory uncertainty | Jurisdiction-aware policy framework; legal counsel integration; access-rights model avoids custody classification |
| User adoption | Integration with existing Stellar wallets (Freighter, Lobstr) reduces friction; SDK-first approach |
| Key person risk | 10+ person engineering team with documented architecture; all code open-source |

---

## Why Fund Zelf Legacy?

1. **Execution certainty**: We have a shipping product, production infrastructure, and multi-chain development experience. We are not starting from architecture slides.

2. **Superior technology**: ZelfProof biometric encryption is production-proven, serverless, and privacy-preserving. We adapt existing infrastructure rather than building ZK circuits from scratch.

3. **Safer architecture**: Access-rights inheritance keeps funds in user wallets. Fund-transfer approaches create systemic risk.

4. **Stronger verification**: Three-layer biometric verification (heartbeat + liveness + KYC) beats single-oracle dependency.

5. **Ecosystem value**: Our SDKs bring an existing developer community and enterprise partnerships to Stellar.

6. **Budget efficiency**: We're adapting proven Rust code and production infrastructure to Soroban, not building everything from scratch. Every dollar goes further.

7. **Long-term sustainability**: Zelf has a revenue model (SaaS licensing) that ensures post-grant sustainability.

---

## Open Source Commitment

All Stellar-specific deliverables will be open-sourced under the MIT license:

- Soroban inheritance contracts
- Heartbeat protocol implementation
- Guardian Oracle interface
- Developer SDKs (TypeScript + Rust)
- Demonstration application
- Documentation and integration guides

Core ZelfProof biometric engine remains proprietary (trade secret) but is available via published SDKs with free tier access for Stellar ecosystem developers.

---

## Summary

Zelf Legacy represents the most credible, technically mature, and immediately executable inheritance infrastructure proposal for the Stellar ecosystem. We are not asking the SCF to fund a research project. We are asking it to fund the Stellar adaptation of production infrastructure that is already being built across multiple chains.

The $90,000 investment will deliver:
- A complete Soroban inheritance contract suite
- Privacy-preserving heartbeat protocol
- Multi-signal death verification oracle
- Developer SDKs for wallet and custodian integration
- A demonstration application
- Mainnet deployment with ongoing maintenance

All built on top of the only serverless, offline-capable biometric encryption technology in the blockchain ecosystem.

**Zelf Legacy: Inherit your legacy without compromise.**
